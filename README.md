### Guidelines

This is a pair programming assignment. You and a partner can divide up the work. Although both of you may not work on all parts of the program you should understand and be able to fully explain every portion of the code. Outside of your team, it is permissible to consult with classmates to ask general questions about the assignment, to help discover and fix specific bugs, and to talk about high level approaches in general terms. It is not permissible to give or receive answers or solution details from fellow students.

You may research online for additional resources; however, you may not use code that was written specifically to solve the problem you have been given, and you may not have anyone else help you or your partner write the code or solve the problem. You may use code snippets found online, providing that they are appropriately and clearly cited, within your submitted code.

If you or your partner are found to have plagiarized any part of the assignment, both will receive a 0 and be reported.

__In this program, you will learn to__:

* Work with sequential and secondary data structures

For the last program you and partner are going to build both a dynamic array (vector) and a linked list. Each data structure will be tested to ensure the validity of its operations. Once that is complete and you know your data structures are working, we are going to use them as internal data structures for a Stack and a Queue. I have provided code that will evaluate both versions of the Stack and Queue to see which provides better performance.

To make our code more portable, we are going to wrap our data in a Data struct and build all our operations around this data type. In a header file, data.h, create a struct, Data, that contains the following:
* a single integer called, ‘value’

Since we are going to be passing by value, we will not need a constructor or destructor.

:warning: *For all Data Structures, you may (and probably should) add additional functions, methods, and attributes, but what follows is the required minimum interface*

## Part A: Vectors
You must break up your code into vector.h and vector.c according to the conventions we discussed in class.

Create a dynamic array data structure, Vector. You must create your struct and internal array on the heap (using malloc). Your dynamic array should have, at minimum, the following:
    ```
        Data data //A pointer to a Data struct array
        int current_size//an integer containing the current size
        int max_size // an integer containing the maximum capacity
        void (*insert)(Vector *, int, Data) //a function pointer to an insert function
        Data * (*read)(Vector *, int)//a function pointer to an read function
        void (*remove)(Vector *, int)//a function pointer to an delete function
        void (*delete)(Vector *)//a function pointer to a destructor
    ```
You must create the following functions for your Vector
* Constructor - initializes the vector struct attributes and returns a pointer to a Vector struct created on the heap
    * `Vector * newVector()`

:bulb: The remaining function names are suggestions since the driver code calls them all via function pointers

* Insert - inserts an element at the specified index. Use the 2n+1 geometric expansion formula to increase the size of your list if the index is out of the current bounds.
    * `void insertVector(Vector *, int, Data);`
* Remove - deletes an element from the list at the specified index.
    * `void removeVector(Vector *, int);`
        * You must implement true deletion, which will reduce the size of the vector by 1
* Read - return the pointer to the data struct from the specified index, return NULL if the index is out of bounds, and a data struct with the value set to -1 if the index has not been initialized
    * `Data * readVector(Vector * array, int index);`
* Destructor - free all allocated memory for the vector
    * `void * deleteVector`
        * frees all struct memory
        * You should return a NULL pointer from any delete procedure. This is just a convention.

## Part B: Linked Lists
You must break up your code into list.h and list.c according to the conventions we discussed in class.

Your node struct must have the following:
```
    struct Node * next/prev; // A pointer to the next and previous nodes
    Data data; // A data object (:note: not a pointer)
```
Your list struct must have the following:
```
    Node * head, tail //A pointer to nodes at the head and tail
    void (*insert)(List *, int, Data) //a function pointer to an insert function
    Data * (*read)(List *, int) //a function pointer to a read function
    void (*remove)(List *, int) //a function pointer to an delete function
    void (*delete)(List *) //a function pointer to a destructor
```
Create a doubly linked list using a list and node structs. You must create your linked list on the heap (using malloc). Your linked list should have the following operations:
* Constructor - initializes the linked list struct:
    * `List * newList()`
        * A pointer to a head and tail node, both initialized to NULL
        * set function pointers to the appropriate functions
        * returns a pointer to a List struct created on the heap

:bulb: The remaining function names are suggestions since the driver code calls them all via function pointers

* Insert - inserts an element at a specified index in the list.
    * `void insertList(List * list, int index, Data value);`
        * Adds the Data to the specified index
        * If the index is out of bounds, adds the data to the end of your list.
* Delete - deletes an element from a specified index in the list.
    * `void removeData(List * list, int index);`
        * If the index is out of bounds, you should just return without doing anything.
* Read - returns a pointer to the data element stored in the list
    * `Data * readData(List * list, int index);`
        * If the index is out of bounds, return a NULL pointer

## Part C: Stacks and Queues

### Stack
You must break up your code into stack.h and stack.c according to the conventions we discussed in class.

You will have two Stack structs, Stacklist and Stackvector. You will be using your list and vector as the internal data structure, respectively.

#### Stacklist

Your Stacklist must have the following:
```
    List * data;
    Data (*peek)(struct stacklist *);
    Data (*pop)(struct stacklist *);
    void (*push)(struct stacklist *, Data);
    void (*clear)(struct stacklist *);
    void (*delete)(struct stacklist *);
```

You must create your Stacklist on the heap (using malloc). Your Stacklist should have the following operations:
* Constructor - initializes the List struct:
    * `Stacklist * newStacklist()`
        * initializes internal List struct
        * set function pointers to the appropriate functions
        * returns a pointer to a Stacklist struct created on the heap

:bulb: The remaining function names are suggestions since the driver code calls them all via function pointers

* Push - pushes a value onto the top of the stack
    * `void pushStacklist(struct stacklist *, Data);`
        * Adds the Data to the stack
* Pop - deletes and returns an element from the stack
    * `Data popStacklist(struct stacklist *);`
        * Removes the top element on the stack
        * If the stack is empty return a Data struct with -1 for a value
* Peek - returns an element from the stack without deleting
    * `Data peekStacklist(struct stacklist *);`
        * Returns but does not remove the top element on the stack
        * If the stack is empty return a Data struct with -1 for a value
* Clear - removes all elements form the stack
    * `void clearStacklist(struct stacklist *);`

## Part D: Profiling

Welcome to the easy part. If you made it this far, you can sit back and relax. I have included a source file called profile.c/.h. Inside this file I have implemented functions that test the operations for both your stacks and queues.

Pay attention to the output.
* What implementation is better for insertion?
* Reading?
* Overall?

## Part E: Submission

### Required file naming and organization:
* program5.c //Driver Code
* data.h
* list.c/.h
* profile.c/.h (provided)
* queue.c/.h
* stack.c/.h
* vector.c/.h
* makefile
    * You must have the following labels in your makefile:
        * all - to compile all your code to an executable called ‘program4’ (no extension). Do not run.
        * run - to compile if necessary and run
        * memcheck - to compile only if necessary and run with valgrind
        * clean - to remove all executables and object files

:no_entry: Every program will have a required submission guidelines. Please read submission requirements carefully. Any deviations from specifications will result in point deductions or incomplete grades.
